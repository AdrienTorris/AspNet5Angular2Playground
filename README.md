# AspNet5Angular2Playground
Sample application using technologies : ASP.NET 5, MVC 6, Angular 2, and others ...

I'm discovering Angular 2 (Angular in fact, I'm not a front-end developer at all) and this is my playground to test this framework and see what we can do with it, in a ASP.NET 5 project.
