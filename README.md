# ASP.NET Core & Angular 2 playground

Sample application using technologies : ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET 5), MVC 6, Angular 2, and others ...

I'm discovering Angular 2 (Angular in fact, I'm not a front-end developer at all) and this is my playground to test this framework and see what we can do with it, in a ASP.NET Core project.

To make it work ni your environment, just two settings to change : 
<br />_____- Mappings/BasePath absolute path in app.settings file
<br />_____- localhost's port number in shared url builder helper (AppScripts/shared/constants/UrlBuilderConstants.ts)
