# ASP.NET Core & Angular 2 
## Playground

## Edit
**This project is not maintened anymore. You can see this one if you are interested by Angular 2 and Typescript : https://github.com/AdrienTorris/Angular2TypeScriptASPNETCoreWebApp**

Sample application using technologies : **ASP.NET Core** (ASP.NET 5), MVC 6, **Angular 2**, and others ...

I'm discovering Angular 2 (Angular in fact, I'm not a front-end developer at all) and this is my playground to test this framework and see what we can do with it, in a ASP.NET Core project.

<br /><br />
To make it work in your environment, just two settings to change : 
* Mappings/BasePath absolute path in app.settings file
* localhost's port number in shared url builder helper (AppScripts/shared/constants/UrlBuilderConstants.ts)
<br /><br />
