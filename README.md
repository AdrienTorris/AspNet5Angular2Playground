# AspNet5Angular2Playground
Sample application using technologies : ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET 5), MVC 6, Angular 2, and others ...

I'm discovering Angular 2 (Angular in fact, I'm not a front-end developer at all) and this is my playground to test this framework and see what we can do with it, in a ASP.NET Core project.

To make it work ni your environment, just two settings to change : 
     - Mappings/BasePath absolute path in app.settings file
	 - localhost's port number in shared url builder helper (AppScripts/shared/constants/UrlBuilderConstants.ts)
